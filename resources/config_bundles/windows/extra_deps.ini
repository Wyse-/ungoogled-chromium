# Use a pre-built LLVM toolchain from LLVM for convenience
# Developer notes:
# * Releases of LLVM are available as "Clang for Windows (64-bit)" on LLVM's download page.
# * If the current stable version of LLVM is causing problems with the build, try
#   matching Google's LLVM version (defined by the `CLANG_REVISION` variable in by
#   downloading a snapshot build at the version specified by `CLANG_REVISION` and
#   `VERSION` constants in `tools/clang/scripts/update.py`. For example,
#   revision 123456 of LLVM 9.8.7 64-bit Windows would be:
#   `http://prereleases.llvm.org/win-snapshots/LLVM-9.8.7-r123456-win64.exe`
#   (link derived from [LLVM Snapshot Builds](http://llvm.org/builds/))
